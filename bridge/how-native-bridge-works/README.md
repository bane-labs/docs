# How Native Bridge Works

A cross-chain bridge is a software protocol that allows for the smooth transfer of data and assets between different blockchain networks. The transfer of data can be regarded as messages moving from one chain to another. These messages may include specific actions that facilitate the transfer of crypto assets.

In the context of Neo X, this project aims to bridge:

* From **Neo N3** to **Neo X** (_N3->NeoX_);
* From **Neo X** to **Neo N3** (_NeoX->N3_);

In the following sections we will elabrate on how and why Merkle Trees play a role in the solution, why we call the solution as the "decoupled relayer", the architecture, the roles with their responsibilities, and the involved smart contracts.
