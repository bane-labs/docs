# Introduction

Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graphâ€™s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized. By supporting The Graph, dApps on NeoX can more easily access and query complex data stored on the blockchain.
