# Supra

[Supra](https://supra.com) is a novel, high-throughput Oracle & IntraLayer: A vertically integrated toolkit of cross-chain solutions (data oracles, asset bridges, automation network, and more) that interlink all blockchains, both public (L1s and L2s) and private (enterprises).

Supra provides decentralized oracle price feeds that can be used for both on-chain and off-chain use cases such as spot and perpetual DEXes, lending protocols, and payment protocols. Supra’s oracle chain and consensus algorithm make it the fastest-to-finality oracle provider, with layer-1 security guarantees. The pull oracle has a sub-second response time. In addition to speed and security, Supra’s rotating node architecture gathers data from 40+ data sources and applies a robust calculation methodology to obtain the most accurate value. The node provenance on the data dashboard also provides a fully transparent historical audit trail. Supra’s Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) paper was accepted into ICDCS 2023, the oldest distributed systems conference.
