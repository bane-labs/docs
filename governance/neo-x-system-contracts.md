# Neo X System Contracts

Neo X system contracts are a set of build-in Solidity contracts with predefined addresses. They represent the governance and economic model of Neo X, which is fully decentralized and transparent.

These contracts are not deployed by transactions but allocated in the [genesis file](https://github.com/bane-labs/go-ethereum/blob/bane-main/config). The address setting of existing pre-compiled contracts is listed as below.

### GovernanceVote

[GovernanceVote](https://github.com/bane-labs/go-ethereum/blob/bane-main/contracts/solidity/GovernanceVote.sol) is a public "library" that is widely used in the system contract management especially upgrade.

Any contract inheriting `GovernanceVote.sol` can set up a consensus vote on method execution, by calling internal `vote(bytes32 methodKey, bytes32 paramKey)`, which requires **more than half** of the **current consensus** votes for **the same method call and the same calling parameters**.

1. More than half - the threshold value is `1/2` instead of `2/3`;
2. Current consensus - if an address is no longer a consensus member, its votes will not be counted;
3. The same method and parameters - it means the majority votes for the same execution result.

### GovProxyAdmin

[GovProxyAdmin](https://github.com/bane-labs/go-ethereum/blob/bane-main/contracts/solidity/GovProxyAdmin.sol) controls the upgrade of other pre-compiled system contracts, since all of their `onlyOwner`/`onlyAdmin` point to `0x1212000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

This contract inherits `GovernanceVote.sol` so that it requires a `50%` majority votes among current consensus to execute `upgradeAndCall(...)`, which means **more than half** of the **current consensus** votes for **the same contract implementation**.

All of the upgradable Neo X system contracts use [ERC1967Proxy](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v5.0/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Proxy.sol) and [UUPSUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v5.0/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol).

### Governance

[Governance](https://github.com/bane-labs/go-ethereum/blob/bane-main/contracts/solidity/Governance.sol) is responsible for the election of consensus nodes and related reward distribution.

An election is, **GAS holders** vote for **registered candidates** and the Governance contract selects **top 7 candidates** as consensus nodes for **the next epoch\***.

\*Epoch is a unit of measurement for blocks. Currently, 1 epoch on testnet is the equivalent of `60480` blocks, which is the storage value `epochDuration` may be retrieved by contract calls.

#### Candidate

An EOA account is allowed to become a candidate only after successful registration via Governance contract with required registration fee deposit staked. The following requirements should be met for successful registration:

1. Registrant invokes `registerCandidate(uint shareRate)` of `0x1212000000000000000000000000000000000001` as message sender;
2. Registrant is an EOA account and not yet a candidate;
3. Put at least `1000 GAS` deposit `value` along with the transaction as registration fee;
4. Provide a `shareRate` ranges from `0` to `1000` in parameters, which is a distribution ratio in thousandths. It determines how many rewards of the total that voters can share, and can not be changed until the candidate exits;
5. (optional) Withdraw past deposits if it has registered and exited before.

If all conditions are met, the new candidate will be added to the candidate list. Only registered candidates can receive votes to be elected as a consensus node.

A candidate can exit without any permission, but it requires 2 epochs to pass until the candidate is allowed to withdraw its registeration deposit. During this period, the candidate can't receive any votes or become a consensus node, but voters can revoke their votes and choose other candidates to share rewards.

#### Election

All GAS holders can vote and benefit from Neo X Governance, including EOA accounts and smart contracts. The following requirements should be met for a successful vote:

1. Voter invokes `vote(address candidateTo)` of `0x1212000000000000000000000000000000000001` as message sender;
2. Put at least `1 GAS` vote `value` along with the transaction;
3. The provided `candidateTo` address is listed in the current candidates;
4. (optional) Revoke votes to other candidates if has voted before.

Neo X Governance doesn't allow voting for multiple candidates and doesn't distribute rewards to new voters until a new epoch begins. So be careful to revoke or change your vote target.

At the end of every election epoch, the 7 candidates with the highest amount of votes will be selected by Governance and become consensus nodes of the next epoch. However, this consensus set recalculation has two prerequisites:

1. The size of candidate list is larger than `7`;
2. The amount of total valid votes is higher than `3,000,000 GAS`.

Otherwise, the consensus nodes of the next epoch will be the following predefined stand-by members.

| Testnet Stand-by Address                     |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| `0xcbbeca26e89011e32ba25610520b20741b809007` |
| `0x4ea2a4697d40247c8be1f2b9ffa03a0e92dcbacc` |
| `0xd10f47396dc6c76ad53546158751582d3e2683ef` |
| `0xa51fe05b0183d01607bf48c1718d1168a1c11171` |
| `0x01b517b301bb143476da35bb4a1399500d925514` |

| `0xd711da2d8c71a801fc351163337656f1321343a0` |

#### Reward

Neo X Governance reward distribution is real-time. Once a candidate is selected as a consensus node, it automatically starts to receive `GAS` rewards via participation in the dBFT consensus.

The governance reward in Neo X is always distributed to two parts, the first part is distributed to consensus nodes and the second is distributed to voters according to the `shareRate` settings.

**Consensus Node Distribution**

Regardless of consensus leader and received vote amount, all of the **transaction priority fees** are **equally divided** among consensus nodes as block rewards. Unlike N3, **other registered candidates receive no reward for the whole epoch**.

$blockReward=totalNetworkTips/7$

In Neo X dBFT, the block coinbase address is always `0x1212000000000000000000000000000000000003`, which means the rewards are first minted to [GovReward](https://github.com/bane-labs/go-ethereum/blob/bane-main/contracts/solidity/GovReward.sol) contract and then transfered to [Governance](https://github.com/bane-labs/go-ethereum/blob/bane-main/contracts/solidity/Governance.sol) contract during `OnPersist()` system call execution in the start of every subsequent block.

**Voter Distribution**

If the `shareRate` of a consensus node is higher than `0`, then `blockReward` will be split again between the consensus node and its voters.

For the consensus node, <img src="../.gitbook/assets/1715058039603.png" alt="" data-size="line">

For each of its voters,  <img src="../.gitbook/assets/1715057942346.png" alt="" data-size="line">

Voter `GAS` reward is proportional to different `shareRate` settings and the voter's weight, i.e. the ratio of voter's votes to the overall number of candidate's votes.

The rewards for consensus nodes will be immediately sent to their addresses, but the reward settlement for voters obeys some other rules:

1. The rewards after first vote but before the next epoch starts are unclaimable, which means a voter can't benefit without participanting and affecting any election;
2. A voter has to send a calling (e.g. `claimReward()`) by itself to `0x1212000000000000000000000000000000000001` to receive claimable rewards;
3. The rewards are claimed and transfered as well when the vote amount changes via `vote(address candidateTo)` or `revokeVote()`.

There are several special cases of reward distribution:

1. When consensus nodes are stand-by validators, they will not share any reward to the network;
2. Voter rewards will not disappear if the voted candidate exits. However, it is possiable that a candidate exits and returns with a different `shareRate` after 2 epochs. It will affect your future benefits so voters are recommended to keep an eye on the voted candidate's activities.

### Policy

[Policy](https://github.com/bane-labs/go-ethereum/blob/bane-main/contracts/solidity/Policy.sol) controls the global settings of Neo X protocol, which are forced on every honest node in the network.

The current Neo X Policy maintains following parameters. All these policies are both checked by honest consensus nodes locally and by dBFT globally.

<table><thead><tr><th width="189">Name</th><th width="181">Parameter</th><th>Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Address Blacklist</td><td><code>isBlackListed</code></td><td>Prevent blacklisted addresses to send transactions in Neo X network</td></tr><tr><td>Minimum Transaction Tip Cap</td><td><code>minGasTipCap</code></td><td>Force transaction senders to pay a minimum tip to Neo X Governance</td></tr></tbody></table>

Since all the policy setters adopt the `needVote` modifier, any policy change requires more than 1/2 of the current Neo X consensus nodes votes to be collected.
